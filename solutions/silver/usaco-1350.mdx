## Explanation

Notice that it is optimal to place the heaviest cows at the bottom and the lightest cows at the top, which makes the gap as large as possible. Therefore, we can sort the cows from heaviest to lightest. We maintain a sorted queue such that the top is the current heaviest cow. If a cow can't be added to the current heaviest tower, we know that it cannot be added to any tower, and thus that cow can be ignored.

However, this takes $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ operations for $N$ total cows, which is too slow. To optimize this, instead of considering cows individually, we can group them up by weight and count. Then, by maintaining a queue of cow groups sorted by weight, we can process all cows in $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

Additionally, each time we process the top group of the queue and add a new cow to that group, we can always add this new group back, since it will be lighter than all cows processed before it, since we sorted the cows from heaviest to lightest.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n, m, k;
	cin >> n >> m >> k;
	vector<array<int, 2>> cowGroups(n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> cowGroups[i][0] >> cowGroups[i][1];
		cowGroups[i][1] = min(cowGroups[i][1], m);
	}

	// Sorted list of cows
	sort(cowGroups.begin(), cowGroups.end());

	// Deque that stores the towers based on weight count pairs
	deque<array<int, 2>> towers;

	// Large value for original tower
	towers.push_back({-1e9, m});

	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int amt = cowGroups[i][1];

		// While there are still cows remaining in the current group and they can
		// still be placed onto the top of the queue, process
		while (!towers.empty() && towers[0][0] <= (cowGroups[i][0] - k) && amt > 0) {
			if (towers[0][1] > amt) {
				towers[0][1] -= amt;
				amt = 0;
				break;
			} else {
				amt -= towers[0][1];
				towers.pop_front();
			}
		}

		towers.push_back({cowGroups[i][0], cowGroups[i][1] - amt});
		count += cowGroups[i][1] - amt;
	}
	cout << count;
