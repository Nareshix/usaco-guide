## Explanation

Any valid sequence of dishes consumed must have the following structure:
- Before the last dish, the sum of sweetness and saltiness are both within limits
- The last dish ends up violating one or more of the restrictions

Noticing this structure makes solving the problem much easier! The original problem
required you to care about the order in which you consume dishes, but if the
sum of sweetness and saltiness are all within limits, then we can consume
our dishes in any order.

All that's left is to model a DP state. The most trivial DP state would be
$\texttt{dp}[i][j][k]$, which would equal whether or not we can eat $i$ dishes with a
sweetness sum of $j$ and a saltiness sum of $k$. However, we can drop the $k$
dimension, as we always want to minimize our saltiness sum.

Thus, our final DP state is $\texttt{dp}[i][j]$ equals the minimum saltiness if we eat
$i$ dishes with a sweetness sum of $j$. Then, our transitions follow the typical
form of a knapsack DP, which is

$$
\texttt{dp}[i][j] = \min(\texttt{dp}[i][j], \texttt{dp}[i - 1][j - a] + b)
$$

if we are considering an item with sweetness $a$ and saltiness $b$.

With this, we iterate over all DP states, and find the last value of $i$ where
there's a DP values $\leq Y$. Because we can eat one last item, our printed
answer is $\min(i + 1, n)$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2 X)$

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

constexpr int INF = 1e9;

int main() {
	int n, x, y;
	std::cin >> n >> x >> y;

	// dp[i][j] = min saltiness sum, if we eat i dishes with sweetness sum j
	// note that we consider a max size of n - 1, since any more is useless
	std::vector dp(n, std::vector<int>(x + 1, INF));
	dp[0][0] = 0;

	for (int dish = 0; dish < n; dish++) {
		int a, b;
		std::cin >> a >> b;

		// we iterate in reverse order so we don't need a new DP array
		for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
			for (int j = x; j >= a; j--) {
				dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - a] + b);
			}
		}
	}

	for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		for (int j = 0; j <= x; j++) {
			if (dp[i][j] <= y) {
				std::cout << i + 1 << '\n';
				return 0;
			}
		}
	}
}
```
